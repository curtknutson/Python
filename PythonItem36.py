def start(name=""):
   #1. Assign an integer to a variable
    x=36

    #2. Assign a string to a variable
    course="Python item "

    #3. Assign a float to a variable
    y=52.9

    #4. Use the print function and .format() notation to print out the variable you assigned
    print ("{} {} is {} percent of the way done with Python course.").format(course,x,y)

    operators(x,y)
    logical()
    loopy()
    #13. Call the function you defined above and print the result to the shell
    name = get_name(name)
    print(name)
    print("\nI received the name {} from the function.").format(name)

    multiplication = x * 2
    division = multiplication / 2
    addToSelf = 0
    addToSelf += 1
    modulus = 7 % 2

def logical():
    #6. Use of logical operators: and, or, not
    booleanand = False

    print (booleanand)

    booleanor = True or False
    print (booleanor)

def loopy():
    #9. Use of a for loop
    #10. Create a list and iterate through that list using a for loop to print each item out on a new line
    fruit =["apples","bananas","clementines","dates",]
    for counter in range(0,4):
        # Show the value of fruit in position counter

    for counter in range(0,9):
        # Show the value of fibonacci in position counter
        print fibonacci[counter]
        
#12. Define a function that returns a string variable

    #8. Use of a while loop

        #7. Use of conditional statements: if, elif, else
